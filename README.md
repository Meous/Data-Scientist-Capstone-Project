# Data-Scientist-Capstone-Project
Capstone project for the Data Scientist Nanodegree from Udacity

For this project, I applied Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to predict customer churn in the banking industry.

# Data

Data was obtained from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-datasetz

# Libraries

This project used Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries were used in this project:

1. NumPy
2. pandas
3. Sklearn / scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib (for data visualization)
5. Seaborn (for data visualization)
6. Plotly (for data visualization)
7. XGB

# Project Overview

Customer churn or attrition is one major problem for banks and as Verbeke et al (2011) asserts, putting in efforts to retain customers eventually leads to profitability. This is also affirmed by Tsai and Chen (2010) and they identified churn management as an important strategy for businesses. 

This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques in predicting customer churn in the banking industry and uses dataset from Kaggle.
